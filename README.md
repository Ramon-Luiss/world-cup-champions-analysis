## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis

The analysis includes:

- Ranking champions by offensive efficiency
- Defensive performance comparison
- Offensive vs Defensive scatter analysis
- Correlation heatmap
- Decade-based trend analysis
- Historical performance evolution visualization

---

## 🧠 Key Insights

- Modern champions tend to concede fewer goals per game, indicating increased defensive organization.
- Goal difference appears as a strong indicator of dominant championship campaigns.
- Earlier tournaments had significantly higher scoring averages compared to recent editions.
- Over time, tactical evolution suggests a shift toward balanced performance rather than purely offensive dominance.
